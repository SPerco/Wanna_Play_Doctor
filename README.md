An Ionic Role-Playing Game
This is a text-based game where you get to become an Emergency Physician. Cases are presented, then a step-by-step evaluation and treatment plan, consisiting of multiple choice questions, ensues. Each step you take either adds (if correct or partially correct) or subtracts (for errors).
These cases are based on real-life experiences, so those cases that may seem to be extreme, or fictitious, are not!
I have many cases to include into this game, and have gotten great reviews from those who have seen my UML version. I would appreciate any programmer interested in pushing ionic along with my medical input.
Please get in touch if you like the idea,
